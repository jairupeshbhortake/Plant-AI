# Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

# Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model designed to detect and categorize plant diseases based on leaf images. The goal of this project is to improve precision agriculture by providing an efficient and accurate method for diagnosing plant diseases, enabling early intervention, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

# Abstract

Plants are a vital component of global food production, but they are highly susceptible to various diseases that can lead to significant yield loss. Traditional methods of plant disease detection are manual, time-consuming, and often require expert knowledge, making them inefficient for large-scale agriculture. This project aims to address these challenges by using convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning technique, to automatically diagnose plant diseases from leaf images.

The model is trained on a dataset of approximately 183,000 high-resolution images captured by DSLR sensors as well as on CSV file, covering a wide variety of plants and diseases. By leveraging CNNs, the system can identify patterns in the leaf images, categorize diseases, and provide accurate diagnoses.
